This project allows a user to log in and enter bird sighting that they can save. They can also view other birders' pages.
There is also a blog page where birders can make posts and comment on those posts. There is a media gallery for audio and 
image upload for the community. A user can also search the community bird database. The user can also view data on birds
that comes from an external API. This project brings together tracking birds sightings and posting about bird topics all
on one platform instead of having to perform these tasks on different websites.
